I’m Ciprian Simionov and this is my GitHub portfolio.

I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing.

I’m looking forward to collaborate on different Software Testing opportunities.

----------------------------------------------------------------

During my online QA courses, I've learned about API testing using Postman, manual testing, writing bug reports & test cases, agile methodology and automation testing using CypressJS.

I'm always willing to learn, one of my beliefs is continuous learning.
I am strongly motivated, quite curious, and eager to expand my skills.
